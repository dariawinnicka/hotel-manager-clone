    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we
        believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal
        basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply

      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
        explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your
        personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
        to process your personal information:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 30px">
        • Consent. We may process your information if you have given us

        litigation in which we are involved.<br />
        • Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it

      </p>
      <p>
        In legal terms, we are generally the ‘data controller’ under European
        data protection laws of the personal information described in this
        privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data
        processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the
        personal information we process as a ‘data processor’ on behalf of our
        customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to
        and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the
        ‘data controller’ responsible for your personal information, and we
        merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your
        instructions. If you want to know more about our customers’ privacy
        practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any
        questions you have to them.

      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons

      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,

        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any

        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within

      <b>Verification process</b>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
