      3. What legal bases do we rely on to process your information?
    </p>
    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we
        believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal
        basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply
        with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our
        contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our
        legitimate business interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to
        explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your
        personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
        to process your personal information:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>• Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us
        permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a
        specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.<br />

        <b>• Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal
        information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual
        obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request
        prior to entering into a contract with you.<br />
        <b>• Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we
        believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such
        as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
        exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as
        evidence in litigation in which we are involved.<br />
        <b>• Vital Interests.</b>We may process your information where we
        believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital
        interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential
        threats to the safety of any person.
      </p>
      <p>
        In legal terms, we are generally the ‘data controller’ under European
        data protection laws of the personal information described in this
        privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data
        processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the
        personal information we process as a ‘data processor’ on behalf of our
        customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to
        and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the
        ‘data controller’ responsible for your personal information, and we
        merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your
        instructions. If you want to know more about our customers’ privacy
        practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any
        questions you have to them.

    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>

        The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or

        guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third
        parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this
        privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
        security practices and policies of any third parties, including other

      6. Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?
    </p>
    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
        collect and store your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
        and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about
        how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is
        set out in our Cookie Notice.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="privacy-title">7. How long do we keep your information?</p>
    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to
        fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
        required by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="privacy-title">8. How do we keep your information safe?</p>
    <div class="privacy-paragraph">
      <p>
        <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a
        system of organisational and technical security measures.

      <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within
        a secure environment.

      <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
